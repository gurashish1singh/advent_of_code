# Advent of Code

Playing around with adventofcode[dot]com


### Running the code
    python main.py <year> [the package name] <day> [the module name]

#### Day One
    - Similar to two-sum
    - An extension of the two-sum problem. Adds a third variable to add up to the target.

#### Day Two
    - Sort of a sub-string checker with a letter being present in the string for min and max times
    - An extension of the above but only dealing with positions of the sub-string(single letter) rather than the range

#### Day Three
    - Array indexing problem with given traversal coordinates
    - An extension of the above with different traversal coordinates
